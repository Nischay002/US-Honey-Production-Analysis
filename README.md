The US Honey Project: Trends & Insights üêù

Project Overview

This project analyzes 27 years of US honey production data to identify trends, patterns, and insights into honey consumption, pricing, and production across different states. Using Python, Pandas, and data visualization techniques, we explore how honey production has evolved over time and which states contribute the most to the industry.

Dataset

The dataset (US_honey.csv) contains key information on honey production, pricing, and colony statistics across different US states from 1995 to 2021.

Dataset Features:
	‚Ä¢	state ‚Äì US state name
	‚Ä¢	colonies_number ‚Äì Number of bee colonies per state
	‚Ä¢	yield_per_colony ‚Äì Honey yield per colony
	‚Ä¢	production ‚Äì Total honey production (in pounds)
	‚Ä¢	stocks ‚Äì Honey stock available per state
	‚Ä¢	average_price ‚Äì Average price of honey per year in different states ($ per pound)
	‚Ä¢	value_of_production ‚Äì Total value of honey production per year ($)
	‚Ä¢	year ‚Äì Year of production

Objectives & Key Questions

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to visualize and answer the following key business questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Which states have contributed the least to honey production over the past 27 years?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Which are the top 5 honey-producing states in the US?
3Ô∏è‚É£ How has the mean average price of honey changed from 1995 to 2021?
4Ô∏è‚É£ Which year saw the highest honey production in the entire US?
5Ô∏è‚É£ Which state had the highest contribution to honey production in the peak year (2000)?
6Ô∏è‚É£ Which states had the highest number of bee colonies in the year 2000?

Technologies & Tools Used

üîπ Programming Language: Python
üîπ Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
üîπ Jupyter Notebook & Google Colab

Conclusion

By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into honey production trends and the impact of colony numbers and pricing fluctuations over time. These findings could help beekeepers, agricultural analysts, and policymakers make informed decisions about honey production in the US.
